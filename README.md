## What is Synapse X?

Synapse X eliminates the noise in team collaboration. It connects your GitHub repos and Discord server in real-time, uses AI to detect blockers before they slow your team down, and gives every developer a gamified profile that makes contributions visible and rewarding.

No more manually updating the team. No more missed PRs. No more stale standups.

---

## Features

**⚙️ GitHub + Discord Sync**
Real-time OAuth integration. Automatically tracks PRs, commits, issues, and team chat — zero manual input required.

**🔔 Smart Nudges**
AI detects stalled PRs and blockers. Alerts the right person instantly before the team even notices the problem.

**📈 Predictive Timeline**
An AI ghost-line shows where the project *will* be — not just where it is today.

**🃏 Developer Profiles**
Gamified trading-card profiles with live GitHub stats, level badges, and contribution scores. Makes tracking fun and progress visible.

**🤖 Orb AI Assistant**
A floating AI that answers questions, onboards new members, and auto-generates daily standups every morning.
