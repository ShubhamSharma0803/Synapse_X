What is Synapse X?
Synapse X eliminates the noise in team collaboration. It connects your GitHub repos and Discord server in real-time, uses AI to detect blockers before they slow your team down, and gives every developer a gamified profile that makes contributions visible and rewarding.
No more manually updating the team. No more missed PRs. No more stale standups.
